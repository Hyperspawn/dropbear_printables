# Print Settings Printable Parts

After printing tons of parts and wasting a bunch of material, the idea is to distil my learnings in a document. All parts are validated using a Bambu Lab P1S printer with PLA filament.

## ♻️ Infill Configuration

All `.3mf` print plates have pre-configured infill patterns and densities suited for structural integrity and efficiency.

- **Type**: Gyroid (recommended)
- **Infill Density**: Predefined per part (35–50%)
- **Note**: Do not override unless you're sure.

## 📌 Tips

- Always check for plate flatness before printing large parts.
- Use glue stick or textured PEI sheet for better adhesion.
- Allow parts to cool before removal to avoid warping.

Happy printing!
